# ADVENTURE CHECK
An app to check on the activities of Lambda Adventurers during CS Build Week 2...


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Create an `.env` file in the project directory and add the following:

```
REACT_APP_SERVER_URL='http://full/url/to/endpoint'
REACT_APP_MY_KEY=your_api_key

```

In the project directory, run:

### `yarn start`

That should be about it. Feel free to modify or improve as you see fit!
